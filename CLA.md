# Contributor License Agreement

This Contributor License Agreement ("CLA") ensures that The Autarch Project can maintain, distribute, and relicense contributions as needed — both now and in the future. It's a lightweight agreement that protects both the project and its contributors.

## What You're Agreeing To

By submitting a pull request to this repository, you grant The Autarch Project (maintained by the [autarch-dev](https://github.com/autarch-dev) GitHub organization) a **perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, irrevocable, royalty-free license** to use, reproduce, modify, distribute, sublicense, and relicense your contributions under any terms.

**You retain copyright ownership of your contributions.** This agreement doesn't transfer ownership — it grants the project a license to use your work. You're free to use, license, and distribute your own contributions however you see fit.

## How You Agree

Agreement is indicated by submitting a pull request to this repository. No separate signature, paperwork, or external process is required.

By submitting a PR, you confirm that:

- You have the right to grant this license
- Your contribution is your original work, or you have permission to submit it under these terms
- Your contribution doesn't knowingly violate any third party's intellectual property rights

## Why a CLA?

Open-source projects evolve, and licensing needs can change over time. This CLA gives The Autarch Project the flexibility to adjust licensing in the future — for example, to adopt a newer version of the project's license, to dual-license the project, or to respond to changes in the open-source ecosystem.

Without a CLA, making any licensing change would require tracking down and getting explicit permission from every past contributor. That's impractical for a growing project. This is standard practice for open-source projects that want to remain adaptable while respecting their contributors.
